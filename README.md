# edast

Edast is a web application that serves as a platform for users to request historical records from state archives, such as birth certificates or historical cadastral maps. In addition, it allows users to make reservations for studying and researching in archives reading rooms.

# Features
---

* User authentication: users can create an account and log in to make requests or reservations.
* Request management: users can create new requests, view their requests (completed or in progress), and receive responses from archive staff.
* Archive material information: users can browse information aids for archival material and digitalized archive documents, but they cannot download them.
* Payment system: if a request has a positive response, the response also includes an offer in a mail attachment with payment methods.
* Request tracking: each request is automatically written in the registry book, and it is assigned to an employee with the least number of requests in process.
* Reading room reservation: users can fill out a form to order archive material for studying and research in archives reading rooms. The app checks the availability of     space in the reading room and offers the user an available day.
